# Experiment Log

Dated entries tracking pipeline runs, acceptance checks, and notable findings for the
batch-recsys-lab silver/gold/contracts pipeline.

## Phase 1 acceptance — silver+gold+contracts (2026-08-05)

Full-scale acceptance run (`run_id 20260805T143256Z-7406fc1`, second of two independent
`make data` rebuilds; first build `run_id 20260805T135836Z-7406fc1` same day).

### Reconciliation waterfall — exact on all edges

**Reviews:**

| stage | rows | delta |
|---|---:|---:|
| raw | 43,886,944 | — |
| silver (post-gate) | 43,365,424 | −521,520 (2 quarantined rating_domain, 477,968 exact duplicates, 43,550 superseded) |
| gold 5-core | 15,473,536 | −27,891,888 (k-core filtering) |

**Items:** 1,610,012 clean through (raw → silver, no quarantine loss).

k-core converged at **iteration 16**: users 18,286,190 → 1,641,026; items 1,609,860 →
368,228. Convergence has a long tail — iterations 8–16 shave fewer than 200 rows total
across both sides, i.e. nearly all of the reduction happens in the first ~7 iterations.

### Determinism

8/8 tables content-identical across two independent `make data` rebuilds (~27.5 min
each).

### Contracts

All contracts pass; `run_audit` exit code 0. Querying `local.dq.dq_results` for the
latest run (`20260805T143256Z-7406fc1`, latest row per `(table_name, check_id)`) shows
**zero rows with `status == 'fail'`** — the only `fail` rows in the ledger belong to
earlier/intermediate audit passes on the same run_id and on the prior run_id
(`20260805T135836Z-7406fc1`, `20260805T121746Z-7406fc1`), superseded by later
re-assertions with `status` downgraded to `measured` (T8 nullable-marking note on
Iceberg `createOrReplace`).

### DQ metrics (latest run, `local.dq.dq_results`)

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| orphan_rate (interactions → items FK, `item_fk`) | 0.0 (0 / 43,365,424) |
| brand_unknown_share | 4.545% (73,178 / 1,610,012) |
| price_unparseable | 316 rows, 0.0196% (316 / 1,610,012) |
| rating_domain violations (gate, silver ingest) | 2 (out of 43,886,944 raw rows; matches the 2 quarantined rows in the waterfall above) |
| rating_domain violations (post-gate, silver/gold) | 0 |

**Brand source share** (`brand_source_share` details JSON, `local.silver.items`):

| source | rows | share of 1,610,012 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Brand field | 1,153,897 | 71.67% |
| Manufacturer fallback | 384,785 | 23.90% |
| Neither (none) | 71,330 | 4.43% |

**Measured vs expected unknown-brand share:** UPGRADE_PLAN.md §7 (and the raw-hazards
note in §"Known raw-data hazards") flags ~18% unknown-brand share as the expectation for
this category. Measured `brand_unknown_share` is **4.545%**, well below the ~18%
expectation — the Manufacturer fallback (23.90% of rows) recovers most of the brand
signal that would otherwise show up as unknown, so the *residual* unknown share after
fallback is much lower than the raw/no-fallback expectation.

### Gold table sizes

| table | rows |
|---|---:|
| user_stats | 1,641,026 |
| item_features | 368,228 |
| popularity | 1,223,106 |

### MANIFEST

`data/MANIFEST.md` contains the `## Reconciliation waterfall` section with the funnel
(verified present, not rewritten here).

### Splits

Frozen splits decision: defaults, per `docs/volume_by_month.md`.

## Phase 2 — item-kNN neighbor-truncation selection on VAL (2026-08-06)

**Hypothesis:** larger neighbor lists (`top_n`) improve item-kNN ranking quality;
grid `top_n ∈ {50, 100, 200}` (cosine co-occurrence, shrinkage 0, TRAIN-only fit),
selected by VAL NDCG@10 per the pre-declared rule. TEST untouched during selection.

**Result** (VAL, 356,362 users, full-catalog ranking, run_ids in `results/runs.jsonl`):

| top_n | NDCG@10 | Recall@20 | MRR | wall |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 | 0.001680 | 0.004229 | 0.002341 | 527s |
| 100 | 0.001672 | 0.004270 | 0.002341 | 581s |
| 200 | 0.001671 | 0.004314 | 0.002345 | 655s |

**Verdict:** hypothesis rejected — quality is flat in `top_n` (differences ≪ CI width;
95% CI on NDCG@10 is ±0.0001 for all three). Selection metric VAL NDCG@10 picks
**top_n = 50** (also cheapest to build and score). `configs/eval_itemknn_test.yaml`
finalized to top_n 50 for the single TEST run. Note: strict-cold segment (n_train=0)
scores exactly 0 for kNN as expected — no TRAIN history means zero co-occurrence signal.

## Phase 2 acceptance — eval harness + baselines (2026-08-06)

All runs: TRAIN-only knowledge cutoff, full-catalog ranking (368,228 items,
TRAIN-seen excluded), user-bootstrap 95% CIs (1,000 resamples, seed 20260805),
5 history-depth segments. 10 records in `results/runs.jsonl` (5 TEST evals,
3 VAL kNN-grid evals, 2 paired deltas). TEST touched once per model.

**TEST headline (228,153 users):**

| model | Recall@20 | NDCG@10 |
|---|---:|---:|
| random (seed 13) | 0.0001 | 0.0000 |
| popularity all-time | 0.0035 | 0.0008 |
| item-kNN (top_n=50) | 0.0025 | 0.0009 |
| popularity per-category (t12m) | 0.0142 | 0.0047 |
| **popularity trailing-12m** | **0.0178** | **0.0054** |

**Acceptance criterion 3 — windowing delta (paired bootstrap, CI excludes 0 on all
7 metrics):** trailing-12m − all-time = **+0.0046 NDCG@10 [+0.0044, +0.0048]**,
+0.0143 Recall@20 [+0.0139, +0.0148]. A 12-month window is ~6× better than all-time
popularity on Electronics — catalog churn dominates.

**Failed hypothesis (logged, not discarded):** expected item-kNN to beat popularity
in deep-history segments (early crossover signal). It does not — kNN loses to
trailing-12m popularity in EVERY segment (20+: 0.0006 vs 0.0037 NDCG@10; paired
delta −0.0045 NDCG@10 [−0.0047, −0.0042] globally). Plausible mechanism: 2023 TEST
purchases concentrate on items released after train_end with little/no TRAIN
co-occurrence mass, which recency-windowed popularity partially tracks and static
co-occurrence cannot. Popularity NDCG@10 declines with history depth (0.0075 cold →
0.0037 at 20+), so the "popularity stops working for deep users" half of the
crossover thesis IS visible; the "personalization takes over" half now rests on
ALS/content (Phase 3+).
